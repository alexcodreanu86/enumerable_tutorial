#Include Enumerable in your class

###Description:

Sometimes you may wind up with a class in ruby that acts kinda like a container (like an array or hash) and you would wish to have all those nice methods that arrays have like ```#map ``` or ```#select``` or even ```#inject```. These are some nice methods and you could totaly rewrite your own methods to simulate the same behavior (this is a great way to learn what enumerable methods actually do), but after a while it get's anoying to reinvent the weel everytime you need something like ```select``` and ```map```.
